# AI Peer Programmer

Hello fellow devs. In here, I share my experiences with GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT as peer programmers.
I used Visual Studio Code with "GitHub Copilot" extension installed.

## Test cases
Refer `TestCases.md` for details.

## Code refactor
Refer `CodeRefactor.md` for details.

## Pattern completion
Refer `PatternCompletion.md` for details.

## Pinch of salt
Take suggestions from Copilot as first draft, which needs review, specially on following lines:
- Order of complexity
- Security vulnerability
- Solving our requirement or not

Try to modify the prompt, be more specific to get better results.

Use descriptive names for variables, functions and classes.
