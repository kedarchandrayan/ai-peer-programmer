# AI Peer Programmer

Hey devs! I'm here to share my experience working with GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT as peer programmers.

## GitHub Copilot
Prerequisites: In Visual Studio Code, install the "GitHub Copilot" extension and login with GitHub.

### Code refactor
Refer [CodeRefactor.md](https://github.com/kedarchandrayan/ai-peer-programmer/blob/main/CodeRefactor.md) for details.

### Test cases
Refer [TestCases.md](https://github.com/kedarchandrayan/ai-peer-programmer/blob/main/TestCases.md) for details.

### Regex
Refer [lib/Regex.js](https://github.com/kedarchandrayan/ai-peer-programmer/blob/main/lib/Regex.js) for details.

### Pattern completion
Refer [PatternCompletion.md](https://github.com/kedarchandrayan/ai-peer-programmer/blob/main/PatternCompletion.md) for details.

### Pinch of salt
Take suggestions from Copilot as first draft, which needs review, specially on following lines:
- Order of complexity
- Security vulnerability
- Solving our requirement or not

Try to modify the prompt, be more specific to get better results.

Use descriptive names for variables, functions and classes.
